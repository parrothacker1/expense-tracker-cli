## ‚ú® Announcing v1.0.0!

This `v1.0.0` release marks the first stable version of ExpenseTracker. The core features for adding, listing, updating, and deleting expenses are complete, robustly tested, and ready for use.

---

## Features

- **üìù Full CRUD Operations:** Add, update, and delete expenses with simple commands.  
- **üìä Powerful Filtering:** List and view expenses with filters for category, month, or a specific date range.  
- **üõ°Ô∏è Safe By Default:** Deletions are "soft" by default (records are hidden, not erased). Use the `--permanent` flag for irreversible hard deletes.  
- **Interactive Confirmation:** Destructive actions (like deleting multiple items) require confirmation, preventing accidental data loss.  
- **üíª Cross-Platform:** A single binary works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, thanks to Go.  
- **üì¶ Self-Contained:** No external dependencies needed to run; just the binary and your database file.

## üöÄ Installation

The easiest way to get started is by downloading a pre-compiled binary from our latest release.

### From GitHub Releases (Recommended)

1. Go to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/parrothacker1/expense-tracker-cli/releases/latest).  
2. Find the asset for your operating system and architecture (e.g., `expensetracker-linux-amd64`, `expensetracker-windows-amd64.exe`).  
3. Download the binary.  
4. (Optional but recommended) Place the binary in a directory that is in your system's `PATH` (like `/usr/local/bin` on Linux/macOS) and rename it to `expensetracker`. This allows you to run it from anywhere.  

### From Source

If you have Go installed, you can build it from the source code.

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/parrothacker1/expense-tracker-cli.git
cd expense-tracker-cli

# Build the binary
go build -o expensetracker .

# Now you can run it
./expensetracker --help
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Testing

Contributions are welcome!

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.21 or newer)  
- `bats-core` for running the test suite.  

### Testing

This project uses **`bats-core`** for robust end-to-end integration testing. This approach was chosen because it allows us to test the compiled application binary exactly as a user would. The test suite simulates real command-line usage and verifies the application's output, exit codes, and database state.

To run the full test suite:

```sh
bats test.bats
```
